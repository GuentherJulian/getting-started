== Repositories
The GitHub repositories within the https://github.com/devonfw[devonfw organization] contain the source code, documentation and wikis of individual devonfw projects.

== Distribution
The devonfw https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/devonfw/tools/ide/devon-ide-scripts/[distribution] contains scripts that will help you manage your projects as well as the software packages used by devonfw. It is provided in the form of a `.tar.gz` archive (we recommend https://www.7-zip.org/[7-Zip] to unpack this archive on Windows).

== Guide
The devonfw https://github.com/devonfw/devonfw-guide/raw/master/devonfw_guide.pdf[guide] is a PDF document with over 900 (!) pages. It represents the totality of devonfw's documentation. It is always up-to-date (due to being automatically generated) and included in each release of the distribution.

== Community
The devon community is active on Microsoft https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3af92c481ec30345a28a5434bc530a882a%40thread.skype/conversations?groupId=503df57a-d454-4eec-b3bc-d6d87c7c24f8&tenantId=76a2ae5a-9f00-4f6b-95ed-5d33d77c4d61[Teams] and https://www.yammer.com/capgemini.com/#/threads/inGroup?type=in_group&feedId=5030942[Yammer].

== Homepage
The official http://www.devonfw.com/[homepage] represents a major public presence for devonfw and is meant to attract new framework users as well as customers for Capgemini.
