= The devon IDE
First we have to clarify what we are talking about, when we mention the *devon IDE*:

The devon IDE is _not_ one monolithic program that is installed with a traditional executable; rather it's a collection of scripts which are invoked via command line to automate several, repetetive development tasks. These scripts then interact with other tools (e.g. https://maven.apache.org/[Maven], https://jenkins.io/[Jenkins]), frameworks (https://spring.io/[Spring], https://angular.io/[Angular]) or third party IDEs (https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/[Eclipse], https://code.visualstudio.com/download[VS Code], https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[IntelliJ IDEA]) to streamline the development workflow. +
As such, the package size of the IDE is initally very small, the setup is simple, the included software is portable and the whole environment is unobtrusive and light on system resources.

== Setup
Please refer to the https://github.com/devonfw/ide/blob/master/documentation/setup.asciidoc[setup] guide in the devon IDE documentation to learn where to download and how to setup the development environment.

== Usage
Please refer to the https://github.com/devonfw/ide/blob/master/documentation/usage.asciidoc[usage] section in the devon IDE documentation to learn about how to manage workspaces and create launch scripts.

== Commands
Please refer to the https://github.com/devonfw/ide/blob/master/documentation/cli.asciidoc[commandlets] section in the devon IDE documentation to learn more about the `devon` command and available sub-commands.

== Further Reading
To gain more insight into the motivation behind the devon IDE, you can read the https://github.com/devonfw/ide/blob/master/documentation/features.asciidoc[feature] section of the documentation.
