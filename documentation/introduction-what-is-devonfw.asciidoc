= What is devonfw?

image::images/introduction/devonfw-small.png[,align="center",width="250",devonfw, link="https://devonfw.com/"]

Welcome to the *devonfw* platform. This is a product of the CSD industrialization effort to bring a standardized platform for custom software development within Capgemini APPS2. This platform is aimed at engagements where clients do not force the use of a determined technology so we can offer a better alternative coming from our experience as a group.

devonfw is a development platform aiming for standardization of processes and productivity boost, that provides an architecture blueprint for Java/JavaScript applications, alongside a set of tools to provide a fully functional _out-of-the-box_ development environment.

The devonfw name is a registered trademark of image:images/introduction/Capgemini_Logo_Small.png[,width="80",Capgemini,link="https://www.capgemini.com/"].

== Building Blocks of the Platform

=== CobiGen

_CobiGen_ is a code generator included in the context of _devonfw_ that allows users to generate all the structure and code of the components, helping to save a lot of time wasted in repetitive tasks.

Following the same philosophy, CobiGen now bundles a new command line interface (CLI) that enables the generation of code using few commands. This feature allows us to decouple CobiGen from Eclipse and use it alongside VS Code or IntelliJ IDEA.
