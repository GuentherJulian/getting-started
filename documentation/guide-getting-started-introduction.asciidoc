== Contributing Guidelines

If you want to contribute to the framework, please read our https://github.com/devonfw/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.asciidoc[contributing guide] first. Even finding and fixing small issues in the code or documentation can be a huge help for our open source effort.

== Code of Conduct

Aside from the framework, devonfw also aims to foster a diverse community of  developers. To ensure a respectful cooperation amongst all members of this community, please read and follow our https://github.com/devonfw/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.asciidoc[code of conduct].

== The devonfw IDE

In order to start using *devonfw* you'll first need to https://github.com/devonfw/ide/blob/master/documentation/setup.asciidoc#setup[SETUP] the devonfw IDE.

The devon IDE is _not_ one monolithic program that is installed with a traditional executable; rather it's a collection of scripts which are invoked via command line to automate several, repetetive development tasks. These scripts then interact with other tools (e.g. https://maven.apache.org/[Maven], https://jenkins.io/[Jenkins]), frameworks (https://spring.io/[Spring], https://angular.io/[Angular]) or third party IDEs (https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/[Eclipse], https://code.visualstudio.com/download[VS Code], https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[IntelliJ IDEA]) to streamline the development workflow.

As such, the package size of the IDE is initally very small, the setup is simple, the included software is portable and the whole environment is unobtrusive and light on system resources.

TIP: The IDE is provided in the form of a `.tar.gz` archive and needs to be unpacked. We recommend using https://www.7-zip.org/[7-Zip] on Windows. Under Linux simply run `tar -xzf <filename>.tar.gz`.
